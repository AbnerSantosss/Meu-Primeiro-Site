# üå± My first project: The beginning of a journey! üå±

### Welcome visitor! This is my first Repository, and with it the first html and css project I've ever done!

> I posted it exactly as I left it when it was finished, I did this to record how much I could evolve, whenever the imposter syndrome wants to knock the door, I will come here and compare it with my other projects to prove how much I can progress! hahaha
