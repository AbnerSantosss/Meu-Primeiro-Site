# ðŸŒ± My first project: The beginning of a journey! ðŸŒ±



### Welcome visitor! This is my first Repository, and with it the first html and css project I've ever done!

> I posted exactly as I left it when it ended, it's my first site, it's special (I used my son as an astronaut model) I did it to record how much I could evolve, whenever the imposter syndrome wants to knock on the door, I come here to compare with my others projects to prove how far I can come! haha ha
